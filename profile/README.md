# Hi, this is Actonic

To provide you with innovative IT solutions, we have been constantly working to expand our expertise since 2015. We support and inspire people with customized possibilities so that they have more time for tasks that really count. Or to get more coffee.

# Why we get up in the morning

Once working as developers and consultants in the IT industry themselves, our founders Domenico Manzo and Gregor Kasmann strived for IT solutions that put people first. That’s why we focus on services like consulting, training, development and support. Furthermore, with own products, we want to find the best solution for your problem.
